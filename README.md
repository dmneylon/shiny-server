# shiny-server
This repository contains the setup of my Shiny server. It is a git repository under /srv/shiny-server on my server.

To learn how you can get your own Shiny Server in a similar way, read my tutorial about how to set up Shiny Server.

Shiny servers can host shiny apps and R markdown documents.

The config directory contains a few configuration files that are used on the server.
